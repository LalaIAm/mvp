- âœ… **Atomic Design**: Component folder structure ready for scalable UI development

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: Project infrastructure and development environment fully operational
2. ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 2 Ready**: Database Foundation and Design System Implementation
3. ðŸš€ **Next Development Tasks**:
   - PostgreSQL database setup and Prisma migrations
   - Redis configuration for session management
   - Core UI components (Button, Input, Typography atoms)
   - Component testing and documentation

### Short Term (Next Sessions)
1. Complete Milestone 1 Phase 2 (Database + Design System)
2. Begin Milestone 1 Phase 3 (Authentication System)
3. Implement JWT authentication with email verification
4. Set up Google OAuth integration

### Medium Term
1. Complete Milestone 1 (Foundation) entirely
2. Begin Milestone 2 (Core Features - Dashboard, Tarot, Journaling)
3. Implement AI integration with OpenAI GPT-4
4. Build subscription system with Stripe

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Architecture âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Vite, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS v4.1 âœ…
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL/Prisma âœ…
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for interpretations and prompts (schema ready)
- **Desktop**: Electron with SQLite for offline capabilities (planned Milestone 6)

### Design Philosophy
- Calming, mystical but modern aesthetic
- Emphasis on ritual and mindfulness
- Progressive feature discovery
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### User Experience Priorities
1. Seamless reading-to-journaling flow
2. Emotional safety and privacy
3. Meaningful AI-generated insights
4. Pattern recognition and growth tracking

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Approach
- Atomic design principles for component structure
- Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
- Security-first implementation (encryption, JWT, input validation)
- Performance optimization from the start

### User Engagement Strategy
- Subtle subscription prompts after 3-5 sessions
- Value demonstration through premium feature previews
- Focus on emotional connection over aggressive monetization

### Privacy and Security
- User data never used for AI model training
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive journal content
- GDPR compliance with explicit consent mechanisms
- Minimal data collection approach

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Implementation Learnings (Phase 1)
- **TailwindCSS v4.1**: Major change from v3.x - no more tailwind.config.js, uses CSS-first @theme directive
- **Modern Stack Integration**: Vite + React + TailwindCSS v4.1 requires @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- **Monorepo Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns with shared utilities and types
- **Security First**: Comprehensive middleware setup from start prevents technical debt

### Key Requirements Understanding
- Users want **ritual and mindfulness**, not just utility
- AI interpretations must feel **personally relevant**, not generic
- **Privacy is paramount** for vulnerable journaling content
- **Cross-platform consistency** essential for user trust

### Technical Constraints
- Must work offline for desktop journaling
- AI response caching needed for cost management
- Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile experience
- Subscription model requires robust payment processing

### Success Factors
- 4+ minute session times indicate deep engagement
- Pattern recognition creates long-term value proposition
- Emotional color palettes and themes drive premium upgrades
- Development velocity improved by solid foundation setup

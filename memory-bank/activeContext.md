# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Milestone 1 Planning Complete
- âœ… Foundational documentation structure established
- âœ… Project context and technical framework documented
- âœ… Detailed Milestone 1 implementation plan created
- âœ… Plan saved in memory bank (`milestone1-plan.md`)
- âœ… Task created in Dart project management system

**Immediate Priority**: Ready to begin Milestone 1 implementation (Foundation phase).

## Recent Changes

**2025-06-02**: 
- Created `productContext.md` defining project purpose, user experience goals, and success metrics
- Established clear understanding of target audience (mindful journalers, wellness seekers 25-45)
- Documented core user flow from ritual initiation through pattern recognition
- Completed comprehensive Milestone 1 implementation plan
- Created detailed `milestone1-plan.md` with 3-phase approach (Infrastructure, Design System, Authentication)
- Successfully created Dart task "Milestone 1: Foundation Implementation - TarotLyfe" in TarotLyfe/Active space (ID: rFTVR0K8h59a)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. âœ… **Planning Phase Complete**: All memory bank files created and comprehensive Milestone 1 plan established
2. ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Implementation**: Begin Milestone 1 - Foundation phase
3. ðŸš€ **First Development Tasks**:
   - Initialize project repository structure
   - Set up development environment (Vite + Node.js)
   - Configure Tailwind CSS with custom design system
   - Begin atomic design component structure

### Short Term (Next Sessions)
1. Begin Milestone 1 implementation (Foundation setup)
2. Initialize project repository and environment
3. Set up design system with Tailwind CSS
4. Implement basic authentication flow

### Medium Term
1. Complete user authentication and dashboard
2. Implement core tarot reading functionality
3. Build journaling integration with AI prompts

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL/Prisma
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for interpretations and prompts
- **Desktop**: Electron with SQLite for offline capabilities

### Design Philosophy
- Calming, mystical but modern aesthetic
- Emphasis on ritual and mindfulness
- Progressive feature discovery
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### User Experience Priorities
1. Seamless reading-to-journaling flow
2. Emotional safety and privacy
3. Meaningful AI-generated insights
4. Pattern recognition and growth tracking

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Approach
- Atomic design principles for component structure
- Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
- Security-first implementation (encryption, JWT, input validation)
- Performance optimization from the start

### User Engagement Strategy
- Subtle subscription prompts after 3-5 sessions
- Value demonstration through premium feature previews
- Focus on emotional connection over aggressive monetization

### Privacy and Security
- User data never used for AI model training
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive journal content
- GDPR compliance with explicit consent mechanisms
- Minimal data collection approach

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Requirements Understanding
- Users want **ritual and mindfulness**, not just utility
- AI interpretations must feel **personally relevant**, not generic
- **Privacy is paramount** for vulnerable journaling content
- **Cross-platform consistency** essential for user trust

### Technical Constraints
- Must work offline for desktop journaling
- AI response caching needed for cost management
- Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile experience
- Subscription model requires robust payment processing

### Success Factors
- 4+ minute session times indicate deep engagement
- Pattern recognition creates long-term value proposition
- Emotional color palettes and themes drive premium upgrades
- Community guidelines needed for any social features (future)

# Product Context: TarotLyfe

## Why This Project Exists

TarotLyfe addresses the gap between traditional tarot practice and modern digital wellness tools. It serves the growing community of spiritual seekers and mindfulness practitioners who want structured, AI-enhanced self-reflection tools that go beyond basic journaling apps.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problems
- **Shallow Self-Reflection**: Most journaling apps lack guided prompts that connect to deeper symbolic thinking
- **Disconnected Wellness Tools**: Tarot apps and journaling apps exist separately, missing the natural flow from reading to reflection
- **Lack of Personal Growth Tracking**: Users struggle to see patterns and progress in their emotional/spiritual journey
- **Intimidating Tarot Learning Curve**: Traditional tarot requires extensive study; AI interpretation makes it accessible

### Secondary Problems
- **Generic Spiritual Content**: Most apps provide one-size-fits-all content rather than personalized insights
- **Poor Offline Experience**: Users want to journal privately without internet dependency
- **Limited Export Options**: Users can't easily save or share their growth journey

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow
1. **Ritual Initiation**: User opens app, feels calm/centered by design
2. **Card Draw**: Simple, beautiful interface for drawing 1-3 cards
3. **AI Interpretation**: Contextual, personalized reading appears
4. **Reflection Prompt**: AI generates journaling prompt based on cards + user context
5. **Journaling**: Rich-text editor for deep reflection
6. **Pattern Recognition**: System tracks emotional trends and card frequencies
7. **Progress Viewing**: User sees growth over time through visualizations

### Expected User Experience
- **Calming Ritual**: Each session feels meditative and intentional
- **Personal Growth**: Users gain genuine insights about themselves
- **Emotional Safety**: Private, secure space for vulnerable reflection
- **Progressive Discovery**: Features unlock naturally as users engage more deeply

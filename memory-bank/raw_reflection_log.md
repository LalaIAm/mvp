TaskRef: "Milestone 1 Phase 1 Complete: TarotLyfe Foundation Implementation"

### Learnings:
- **TailwindCSS v4.1 Major Changes**: Discovered that TailwindCSS v4+ completely changed configuration approach - no more `tailwind.config.js` file, uses CSS-first configuration with `@theme` directive in CSS files
- **Modern Vite Integration**: TailwindCSS v4.1 requires `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin instead of PostCSS plugin for Vite projects
- **CSS-First Theme Configuration**: Theme variables defined directly in CSS using `@theme { --color-primary: oklch(...); }` syntax instead of JavaScript configuration
- **Monorepo Structure Benefits**: Clear separation between frontend/, backend/, shared/ improves development workflow and dependency management
- **Express Security Setup**: Implementing security middleware (Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting) from the start prevents technical debt
- **Prisma Schema Design**: Comprehensive database schema with proper relationships and constraints sets solid foundation for complex features
- **Development Environment**: Concurrently package excellent for dual-server development (frontend + backend simultaneously)
- **Git Repository Management**: Proper .gitignore and commit structure essential for team development

### Difficulties:
- **TailwindCSS Documentation Confusion**: Initially implemented v3.x configuration before realizing v4.1 has completely different approach
- **Package Configuration**: Required multiple package.json files for monorepo workspaces with proper dependency management
- **Browser Testing Issues**: Puppeteer browser launch failed in environment, but HTTP logs confirmed servers working correctly

### Successes:
- **Complete Infrastructure Setup**: Successfully established full development environment with both servers running
- **Modern Tech Stack Integration**: Properly configured React + Vite + TailwindCSS v4.1 + Express + Prisma
- **Project Management Integration**: Successfully tracked progress in Dart task management system
- **Git Workflow**: Proper initial commit with comprehensive change documentation
- **Design System Foundation**: Established TarotLyfe brand colors and typography system ready for component development

### Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- **TailwindCSS v4+ Implementation Pattern**: CSS-first configuration approach
- **Monorepo Setup Pattern**: Workspace configuration for frontend/backend separation
- **Express Security Configuration**: Comprehensive middleware setup from project start
- **Development Environment Pattern**: Concurrently setup for dual-server development
